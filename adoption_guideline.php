                <h3>Adoptions Guidelines</h3>

                <div id="adoption_guidelines">
                    <p><b>1. Consider and Prepare:</b> You have to consider the time, effort, and financial implications of adopting a pet. Make sure your house is prepared for a new family member.</p>

                    <p><b>2. Choose the Right Pet:</b> Not every pet will be suitable for every home. You must consider the pet's needs, behaviors, and your lifestyle while deciding.</p>

                    <p><b>3. Visit and Interact:</b> Spend time with the pet you have in mind before adoption. This will help you both get comfortable with each other.</p>

                    <p><b>4. Adoption Application:</b> Once youâ€™re ready, fill out the adoption form. We will review the application and might ask to visit your home for inspection.</p>

                    <p><b>5. Approval and Agreement:</b> If everything goes well, you will be asked to sign an adoption agreement. This will also include the understanding of pet care responsibilities.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>6. Bringing the Pet Home:</b> It's time for your new furry friend to come home. Remember, patience and love can help your pet to get accustomed to the new surroundings.</p>

                    <p><b>7. Post Adoption Support:</b> Our team will stay in touch and provide you with any support needed post-adoption to make your pet's transition as smooth as possible.</p>
